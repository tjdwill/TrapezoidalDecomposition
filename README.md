# Trapezoidal Decomposition
A Python Implementation of Trapezoidal Decomposition

I was looking for an implementation of trapezoidal decomposition that allowed one to easily define polygons via vertices but was unable to find one. Fortunately, I was able to code one, PY.

## How to Use

Note: You must edit and then run the code for ease of defining the objects.

0. Define your obstacles in terms of (x, y) coordinates.
1. Define your map boundaries.
2. Run the program
